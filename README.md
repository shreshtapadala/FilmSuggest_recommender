FILMSUGGEST RECOMMENDER - MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

As Steve Jobs once said, “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”

Considering we all buy goods suggested by Amazon, watch videos suggested by YouTube, and watch TV shows suggested by Netflix. People like being guided and given recommendations.

Recommendation systems are information filtering systems that provide individual recommendations. Recommendation systems use machine learning algorithms and techniques to give the relevant suggestions to users by learning data (past behaviors) and predicting current interests or preferences.

These systems may provide such recommendations as:

product recommendations (Amazon) and content recommendations (Youtube, Netflix)

Basically there are three types of recommender systems :

content-based filtering : which generates predictions by analyzing items and searching for similarities between them.

Collaborative filtering : which generates predictions by analyzing user behavior and matching users with similar tastes.

hybrid filtering : which combines two or more models.
