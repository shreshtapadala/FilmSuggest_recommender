FILMSUGGEST RECOMMENDER - MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

As Steve Jobs once said, “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”

Considering we all buy goods suggested by Amazon, watch videos suggested by YouTube, and watch TV shows suggested by Netflix. People like being guided and given recommendations.

Recommendation systems are information filtering systems that provide individual recommendations. Recommendation systems use machine learning algorithms and techniques to give the relevant suggestions to users by learning data (past behaviors) and predicting current interests or preferences.
